 ##  TUN-1.7: Tunnel Interfaces disable and enable - Interface Based GRE Tunnel
 ## Summary
 *   Tunnel Interfaces disable and enable - Interface Based GRE Tunnel
 ## Procedure
 
 *   Apply the config mentioned in Tunnel-1.1 
 *   Send the traffic as mentioned in Tunnel-1.3 and Tunnel-1.4 with TP-1.1 and TP-1.2 
 *   Disable and enable  the numbers of Tunnel interface being used  
 *   Disabling Tunnel interfaces: 
     *  Disable 5 tunnel interfaces 
        *  One by one  
        *  All 5 at once 
 *   Static route using the disable interface should become invalid and should not be used in forwarding traffic 
 *   Incoming traffic on DUT-PORT1 should be load balanced to available Tunnel interfaces for encapsulation 
 *   Incoming traffic flow should be equally distributed for Encapsulation(ECMP) 
 *   No traffic loss expected 
 *   Enable the tunnel interfaces:  
     *  Enable or bring up the same interfaces which were disabled in previous step 
        *  One by one 
        *  All 5 at once 
 *   Incoming traffic on DUT-PORT1 should start using additional Tunnel Interfaces  for encapsulation 
 *   Incoming traffic flow should be equally distributed for Encapsulation(ECMP) 
 *   No traffic loss expected 
 *   Disabling and enabling the number of tunnel interfaces and related static route shouldnâ€™t case traffic drops 
 *   Verify the Next hop counters for packet being diverted or sent for encapsulation 
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces counters to confirm the traffic encapsulation  
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces traffic/flow for equal distribution for optimal load balancing  
 *   After decapsulation, traffic should be load balanced/hash to all available L3 ECMP or LAG or combination of both features 
 *   Verify the tunnel interfaces counters to confirm the traffic decapsulation 
 
 *   Validate system for: 
 *   Health-1.1 
 *   No feature related error or drop counters incrementing, 
 *   discussion with vendors required to highlight additional fields to monitor based on implementation and architecture
